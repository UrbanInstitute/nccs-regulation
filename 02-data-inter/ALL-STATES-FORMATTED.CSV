As used in this section, the word istockholderi means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words istocki and isharei mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words idepository receipti mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository. (b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to ss 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to ss 251(g) of this title), ss 252, ss 254, ss 255, ss 256, ss 257, ss 258, ss 263 or ss 264 of this title: (1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in ss 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger pursuant to ss 251(h), as of immediately prior to the execution of the agreement of merger), were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in ss 251(f) of this title. (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to ssss 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except: a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof; b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders; c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section. (3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under ss 253 or ss 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation. (4) In the event of an amendment to a corporationis certificate of incorporation contemplated by ss 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by ss 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word iamendmenti substituted for the words imerger or consolidation,i and the word icorporationi substituted for the words iconstituent corporationi and/or isurviving or resulting corporation.i (c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d),(e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable. (d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows: (1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with ss 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of ss 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholderis shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholderis shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholderis shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or (2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to ss 228, ss 251(h), ss 253, or ss 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of ss 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of giving such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to ss 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by ss 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of giving such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holderis shares; provided that a demand may be delivered to the corporation by electronic transmission if directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in such notice. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holderis shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to ss 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by ss 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holderis shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given. (e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholderis demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon request given in writing (or by electronic transmission directed to an information processing system (if any) expressly designated for that purpose in the notice of appraisal), shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation (or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to ss 251(h) of this title, the aggregate number of shares (other than any excluded stock (as defined in ss 251(h)(6)d. of this title)) that were the subject of, and were not tendered into, and accepted for purchase or exchange in, the offer referred to in ss 251(h)(2)), and, in either case, with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such statement shall be given to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholderis request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such personis own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection. (f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation. (g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to ss 253 or ss 267 of this title. (h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholderis certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section. (i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Courtis decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state. (j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneyis fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal. (k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholderis demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholderis demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section. (l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation. 8 Del.

In particular, and without limitation upon such general power of amendment, a corporation may amend its certificate of incorporation, from time to time, so as: (1) To change its corporate name; or (2) To change, substitute, enlarge or diminish the nature of its business or its corporate powers and purposes; or (3) To increase or decrease its authorized capital stock or to reclassify the same, by changing the number, par value, designations, preferences, or relative, participating, optional, or other special rights of the shares, or the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such rights, or by changing shares with par value into shares without par value, or shares without par value into shares with par value either with or without increasing or decreasing the number of shares, or by subdividing or combining the outstanding shares of any class or series of a class of shares into a greater or lesser number of outstanding shares; or (4) To cancel or otherwise affect the right of the holders of the shares of any class to receive dividends which have accrued but have not been declared; or (5) To create new classes of stock having rights and preferences either prior and superior or subordinate and inferior to the stock of any class then authorized, whether issued or unissued; or (6) To change the period of its duration; or (7) To delete: a. Such provisions of the original certificate of incorporation which named the incorporator or incorporators, the initial board of directors and the original subscribers for shares; and b. Such provisions contained in any amendment to the certificate of incorporation as were necessary to effect a change, exchange, reclassification, subdivision, combination or cancellation of stock, if such change, exchange, reclassification, subdivision, combination or cancellation has become effective. Any or all such changes or alterations may be effected by 1 certificate of amendment. (b) Every amendment authorized by subsection (a) of this section shall be made and effected in the following manner: (1) If the corporation has capital stock, its board of directors shall adopt a resolution setting forth the amendment proposed, declaring its advisability, and either calling a special meeting of the stockholders entitled to vote in respect thereof for the consideration of such amendment or directing that the amendment proposed be considered at the next annual meeting of the stockholders; provided, however, that unless otherwise expressly required by the certificate of incorporation, no meeting or vote of stockholders shall be required to adopt an amendment that effects only changes described in paragraph (a)(1) or (7) of this section. Such special or annual meeting shall be called and held upon notice in accordance with ss 222 of this title. The notice shall set forth such amendment in full or a brief summary of the changes to be effected thereby unless such notice constitutes a notice of internet availability of proxy materials under the rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. ss 78a et seq.]. At the meeting a vote of the stockholders entitled to vote thereon shall be taken for and against any proposed amendment that requires adoption by stockholders. If no vote of stockholders is required to effect such amendment, or if a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon, and a majority of the outstanding stock of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class has been voted in favor of the amendment, a certificate setting forth the amendment and certifying that such amendment has been duly adopted in accordance with this section shall be executed, acknowledged and filed and shall become effective in accordance with ss 103 of this title. (2) The holders of the outstanding shares of a class shall be entitled to vote as a class upon a proposed amendment, whether or not entitled to vote thereon by the certificate of incorporation, if the amendment would increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of such class, increase or decrease the par value of the shares of such class, or alter or change the powers, preferences, or special rights of the shares of such class so as to affect them adversely. If any proposed amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences, or special rights of 1 or more series of any class so as to affect them adversely, but shall not so affect the entire class, then only the shares of the series so affected by the amendment shall be considered a separate class for the purposes of this paragraph. The number of authorized shares of any such class or classes of stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the corporation entitled to vote irrespective of this subsection, if so provided in the original certificate of incorporation, in any amendment thereto which created such class or classes of stock or which was adopted prior to the issuance of any shares of such class or classes of stock, or in any amendment thereto which was authorized by a resolution or resolutions adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of such class or classes of stock. (3) If the corporation is a nonstock corporation, then the governing body thereof shall adopt a resolution setting forth the amendment proposed and declaring its advisability. If a majority of all the members of the governing body shall vote in favor of such amendment, a certificate thereof shall be executed, acknowledged and filed and shall become effective in accordance with ss 103 of this title. The certificate of incorporation of any nonstock corporation may contain a provision requiring any amendment thereto to be approved by a specified number or percentage of the members or of any specified class of members of such corporation in which event such proposed amendment shall be submitted to the members or to any specified class of members of such corporation in the same manner, so far as applicable, as is provided in this section for an amendment to the certificate of incorporation of a stock corporation; and in the event of the adoption thereof by such members, a certificate evidencing such amendment shall be executed, acknowledged and filed and shall become effective in accordance with ss 103 of this title. (4) Whenever the certificate of incorporation shall require for action by the board of directors of a corporation other than a nonstock corporation or by the governing body of a nonstock corporation, by the holders of any class or series of shares or by the members, or by the holders of any other securities having voting power the vote of a greater number or proportion than is required by any section of this title, the provision of the certificate of incorporation requiring such greater vote shall not be altered, amended or repealed except by such greater vote. (c) The resolution authorizing a proposed amendment to the certificate of incorporation may provide that at any time prior to the effectiveness of the filing of the amendment with the Secretary of State, notwithstanding authorization of the proposed amendment by the stockholders of the corporation or by the members of a nonstock corporation, the board of directors or governing body may abandon such proposed amendment without further action by the stockholders or members. 8 Del.

If any incorporator is not available then any such other instrument may be signed, with the same effect as if such incorporator had signed it, by any person for whom or on whose behalf such incorporator, in executing the certificate of incorporation, was acting directly or indirectly as employee or agent, provided that such other instrument shall state that such incorporator is not available and the reason therefor, that such incorporator in executing the certificate of incorporation was acting directly or indirectly as employee or agent for or on behalf of such person, and that such personis signature on such instrument is otherwise authorized and not wrongful. (2) All other instruments shall be signed: a. By any authorized officer of the corporation; or b. If it shall appear from the instrument that there are no such officers, then by a majority of the directors or by such directors as may be designated by the board; or c. If it shall appear from the instrument that there are no such officers or directors, then by the holders of record, or such of them as may be designated by the holders of record, of a majority of all outstanding shares of stock; or d. By the holders of record of all outstanding shares of stock. (b) Whenever this chapter requires any instrument to be acknowledged, such requirement is satisfied by either: (1) The formal acknowledgment by the person or 1 of the persons signing the instrument that it is such personis act and deed or the act and deed of the corporation, and that the facts stated therein are true. Such acknowledgment shall be made before a person who is authorized by the law of the place of execution to take acknowledgments of deeds. If such person has a seal of office such person shall affix it to the instrument. (2) The signature, without more, of the person or persons signing the instrument, in which case such signature or signatures shall constitute the affirmation or acknowledgment of the signatory, under penalties of perjury, that the instrument is such personis act and deed or the act and deed of the corporation, and that the facts stated therein are true. (c) Whenever any instrument is to be filed with the Secretary of State or in accordance with this section or chapter, such requirement means that: (1) The signed instrument shall be delivered to the office of the Secretary of State; (2) All taxes and fees authorized by law to be collected by the Secretary of State in connection with the filing of the instrument shall be tendered to the Secretary of State; and (3) Upon delivery of the instrument, the Secretary of State shall record the date and time of its delivery. Upon such delivery and tender of the required taxes and fees, the Secretary of State shall certify that the instrument has been filed in the Secretary of Stateis office by endorsing upon the signed instrument the word iFiledi, and the date and time of its filing. This endorsement is the ifiling datei of the instrument, and is conclusive of the date and time of its filing in the absence of actual fraud. The Secretary of State shall file and index the endorsed instrument. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section and in subsection (i) of this section, such filing date of an instrument shall be the date and time of delivery of the instrument. (4) Upon request made upon or prior to delivery, the Secretary of State may, to the extent deemed practicable, establish as the filing date of an instrument a date and time after its delivery. If the Secretary of State refuses to file any instrument due to an error, omission or other imperfection, the Secretary of State may hold such instrument in suspension, and in such event, upon delivery of a replacement instrument in proper form for filing and tender of the required taxes and fees within 5 business days after notice of such suspension is given to the filer, the Secretary of State shall establish as the filing date of such instrument the date and time that would have been the filing date of the rejected instrument had it been accepted for filing. The Secretary of State shall not issue a certificate of good standing with respect to any corporation with an instrument held in suspension pursuant to this subsection. The Secretary of State may establish as the filing date of an instrument the date and time at which information from such instrument is entered pursuant to paragraph (c)(8) of this section if such instrument is delivered on the same date and within 4 hours after such information is entered. (5) The Secretary of State, acting as agent for the recorders of each of the counties, shall collect and deposit in a separate account established exclusively for that purpose a county assessment fee with respect to each filed instrument and shall thereafter weekly remit from such account to the recorder of each of the said counties the amount or amounts of such fees as provided for in paragraph (c)(6) of this section or as elsewhere provided by law. Said fees shall be for the purposes of defraying certain costs incurred by the counties in merging the information and images of such filed documents with the document information systems of each of the recorderis offices in the counties and in retrieving, maintaining and displaying such information and images in the offices of the recorders and at remote locations in each of such counties. In consideration for its acting as the agent for the recorders with respect to the collection and payment of the county assessment fees, the Secretary of State shall retain and pay over to the General Fund of the State an administrative charge of 1 percent of the total fees collected. (6) The assessment fee to the counties shall be $24 for each 1-page instrument filed with the Secretary of State in accordance with this section and $9.00 for each additional page for instruments with more than 1 page. The recorderis office to receive the assessment fee shall be the recorderis office in the county in which the corporationis registered office in this State is, or is to be, located, except that an assessment fee shall not be charged for either a certificate of dissolution qualifying for treatment under ss 391(a)(5)b. of this title or a document filed in accordance with subchapter XVI of this chapter. (7) The Secretary of State, acting as agent, shall collect and deposit in a separate account established exclusively for that purpose a courthouse municipality fee with respect to each filed instrument and shall thereafter monthly remit funds from such account to the treasuries of the municipalities designated in ss 301 of Title 10. Said fees shall be for the purposes of defraying certain costs incurred by such municipalities in hosting the primary locations for the Delaware courts. The fee to such municipalities shall be $20 for each instrument filed with the Secretary of State in accordance with this section. The municipality to receive the fee shall be the municipality designated in ss 301 of Title 10 in the county in which the corporationis registered office in this State is, or is to be, located, except that a fee shall not be charged for a certificate of dissolution qualifying for treatment under ss 391(a)(5)b. of this title, a resignation of agent without appointment of a successor under ss 136 of this title, or a document filed in accordance with subchapter XVI of this chapter. (8) The Secretary of State shall cause to be entered such information from each instrument as the Secretary of State deems appropriate into the Delaware Corporation Information System or any system which is a successor thereto in the office of the Secretary of State, and such information and a copy of each such instrument shall be permanently maintained as a public record on a suitable medium. The Secretary of State is authorized to grant direct access to such system to registered agents subject to the execution of an operating agreement between the Secretary of State and such registered agent. Any registered agent granted such access shall demonstrate the existence of policies to ensure that information entered into the system accurately reflects the content of instruments in the possession of the registered agent at the time of entry. (d) Any instrument filed in accordance with subsection (c) of this section shall be effective upon its filing date. Any instrument may provide that it is not to become effective until a specified time subsequent to the time it is filed, but such time shall not be later than a time on the ninetieth day after the date of its filing. If any instrument filed in accordance with subsection (c) of this section provides for a future effective date or time and if the transaction is terminated or its terms are amended to change the future effective date or time prior to the future effective date or time, the instrument shall be terminated or amended by the filing, prior to the future effective date or time set forth in such instrument, of a certificate of termination or amendment of the original instrument, executed in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, which shall identify the instrument which has been terminated or amended and shall state that the instrument has been terminated or the manner in which it has been amended. (e) If another section of this chapter specifically prescribes a manner of executing, acknowledging or filing a specified instrument or a time when such instrument shall become effective which differs from the corresponding provisions of this section, then such other section shall govern. (f) Whenever any instrument authorized to be filed with the Secretary of State under any provision of this title, has been so filed and is an inaccurate record of the corporate action therein referred to, or was defectively or erroneously executed, sealed or acknowledged, the instrument may be corrected by filing with the Secretary of State a certificate of correction of the instrument which shall be executed, acknowledged and filed in accordance with this section. The certificate of correction shall specify the inaccuracy or defect to be corrected and shall set forth the portion of the instrument in corrected form. In lieu of filing a certificate of correction the instrument may be corrected by filing with the Secretary of State a corrected instrument which shall be executed, acknowledged and filed in accordance with this section. The corrected instrument shall be specifically designated as such in its heading, shall specify the inaccuracy or defect to be corrected, and shall set forth the entire instrument in corrected form. An instrument corrected in accordance with this section shall be effective as of the date the original instrument was filed, except as to those persons who are substantially and adversely affected by the correction and as to those persons the instrument as corrected shall be effective from the filing date. (g) Notwithstanding that any instrument authorized to be filed with the Secretary of State under this title is when filed inaccurately, defectively or erroneously executed, sealed or acknowledged, or otherwise defective in any respect, the Secretary of State shall have no liability to any person for the preclearance for filing, the acceptance for filing or the filing and indexing of such instrument by the Secretary of State. (h) Any signature on any instrument authorized to be filed with the Secretary of State under this title may be a facsimile, a conformed signature or an electronically transmitted signature. (i) (1) If: a. Together with the actual delivery of an instrument and tender of the required taxes and fees, there is delivered to the Secretary of State a separate affidavit (which in its heading shall be designated as an iaffidavit of extraordinary conditioni) attesting, on the basis of personal knowledge of the affiant or a reliable source of knowledge identified in the affidavit, that an earlier effort to deliver such instrument and tender such taxes and fees was made in good faith, specifying the nature, date and time of such good faith effort and requesting that the Secretary of State establish such date and time as the filing date of such instrument; or b. Upon the actual delivery of an instrument and tender of the required taxes and fees, the Secretary of State in the Secretaryis discretion provides a written waiver of the requirement for such an affidavit stating that it appears to the Secretary of State that an earlier effort to deliver such instrument and tender such taxes and fees was made in good faith and specifying the date and time of such effort; and c. The Secretary of State determines that an extraordinary condition existed at such date and time, that such earlier effort was unsuccessful as a result of the existence of such extraordinary condition, and that such actual delivery and tender were made within a reasonable period (not to exceed 2 business days) after the cessation of such extraordinary condition, then the Secretary of State may establish such date and time as the filing date of such instrument. No fee shall be paid to the Secretary of State for receiving an affidavit of extraordinary condition. (2) For purposes of this subsection, an iextraordinary conditioni means: any emergency resulting from an attack on, invasion or occupation by foreign military forces of, or disaster, catastrophe, war or other armed conflict, revolution or insurrection, or rioting or civil commotion in, the United States or a locality in which the Secretary of State conducts its business or in which the good faith effort to deliver the instrument and tender the required taxes and fees is made, or the immediate threat of any of the foregoing; or any malfunction or outage of the electrical or telephone service to the Secretary of Stateis office, or weather or other condition in or about a locality in which the Secretary of State conducts its business, as a result of which the Secretary of Stateis office is not open for the purpose of the filing of instruments under this chapter or such filing cannot be effected without extraordinary effort. The Secretary of State may require such proof as it deems necessary to make the determination required under paragraph (i)(1)c. of this section, and any such determination shall be conclusive in the absence of actual fraud.

(c) If the corporation does not have members, the transaction must be approved by a vote of a majority of the directors in office at the time the transaction is approved. In addition, the corporation shall provide notice of any directors' meeting at which the approval is to be obtained in accordance with section 414D-145(c).

(h) A sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of the property of a corporation shall not be deemed to be the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of all or substantially all the property of the corporation if the corporation is retaining sufficient property to continue one or more significant business segments or lines of the corporation after the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition. Furthermore, the business segments or lines retained must not be only temporary operations or merely a pretext to avoid members' rights which might otherwise arise under this chapter.

Failure to file annual reports; revocation and reinstatement of articles; limitation on authority to do business with the state A. Where a corporation has failed to designate and maintain a registered office and to designate and maintain a registered agent pursuant to the provisions of R.S. 12:236, for a period of one hundred eighty consecutive days, or where a corporation has failed to file an annual report for three consecutive years, according to the records of the secretary of state, the secretary of state shall revoke the articles of incorporation and franchise of such corporation. B. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to prevent the state, through the office of the attorney general, from asserting a cause of action to revoke the articles of incorporation and franchise of a corporation on any of the following grounds: (1) The corporate franchise was procured through fraud practiced upon the state. (2) The corporation has continued to abuse authority conferred upon it. (3) The corporation should not have been formed under this Chapter, or has been formed thereunder without a substantial compliance with the conditions precedent to incorporation prescribed by this Chapter. C. In any case where the secretary of state revokes the articles of incorporation and the corporate franchise, as authorized in Subsection A of this Section, the secretary of state shall, without charge, record notice of such revocation in the conveyance records and the corporation's registry of the office of the clerk of court in the parish where the corporation maintains its registered office and, in the parish of Orleans, such notice shall be recorded in the office of the recorder of mortgages and register of conveyances for said parish. The corporation1 shall not be revoked if the corporation places itself in good standing. D. At least thirty days prior to revoking the articles of incorporation and the corporate franchise, as authorized by Subsection A of this Section, the secretary of state shall give notice to the affected corporation of his intention to revoke the articles of incorporation and the corporate franchise by directing notice of such intention to the last designated registered agent of such corporation, as shown on the records of his office. Such notice shall be in writing and sent to the registered agent by United States mail at the agent's last known address. If there is no registered agent of record, the notice shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office. E.(1) The certificate of incorporation and articles of incorporation shall be reinstated upon the filing, with the secretary of state and within three years from the effective date of the revocation, of an application of reinstatement, signed and acknowledged by an officer of the corporation, accompanied by a reinstatement fee and a current annual report. However, if a suit for liquidation or receivership has been filed at the time the reinstatement is applied for, then the unanimous written consent to the reinstatement by the shareholders, certified by the corporation's secretary to contain the signatures of all of the shareholders, must also be filed with the application for reinstatement. (2) The secretary of state shall furnish the certificate of reinstatement in duplicate, one copy of which shall be filed by the corporation with the clerk of court or, in Orleans Parish, with the recorder of mortgages and register of conveyances. Upon filing the current annual report and payment of the reinstatement fee and upon filing the unanimous written consent of the shareholders to the reinstatement, certified by the corporation's secretary if a suit for liquidation or receivership has been filed, the certificate of reinstatement of such charter and articles of incorporation shall be retroactive and the charter and articles of incorporation shall continue in existence as though the revocation had never occurred. (3) After revocation of the charter or articles of incorporation, the corporate name shall not be available to any other corporation for a three-year period. After three years have expired, if the corporate name is still available, the corporation can be reinstated by following the same procedures and by satisfying the same provisions and requirements as set forth herein.

Dissolution voluntary or involuntary, out of court or under judicial supervision; effect of proceeding for dissolution A. A corporation may be dissolved and liquidated either voluntarily or involuntarily. If the proceedings are voluntary, they may be conducted either out of court or subject to supervision by the court. If the proceedings are involuntary, they shall be subject to supervision by the court. B. If the corporation to be dissolved is a corporation other than a religious or charitable corporation or a corporation for the execution of a trust, the net assets may be distributed to the members as their respective interests appear on the books of the corporation. If the corporation is a religious or charitable corporation or a corporation for the execution of a trust, the net assets shall be transferred to a public or private corporation, association or agency having similar purposes, unless the original articles of the corporation, as initially filed with the Secretary of State, expressly authorize some other disposition of its net assets upon dissolution. C. A proceeding for dissolution takes effect: (1) When the appointment of a liquidator appointed by the members becomes operative as provided in R.S. 12:250(C), if the proceeding, when commenced, is not subject to supervision by the court; or (2) When the court has appointed, pursuant to R.S. 12:250(E) or 251(E), a judicial liquidator or a temporary liquidator, if the proceeding, when commenced, is subject to the supervision of the court.

Failure to file annual reports; revocation and reinstatement of articles; limitation on authority to do business with the state A. Where a corporation has failed to designate and maintain a registered office and to designate and maintain a registered agent pursuant to the provisions of R.S. 12:236, for a period of one hundred eighty consecutive days, or where a corporation has failed to file an annual report for three consecutive years, according to the records of the secretary of state, the secretary of state shall revoke the articles of incorporation and franchise of such corporation. B. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to prevent the state, through the office of the attorney general, from asserting a cause of action to revoke the articles of incorporation and franchise of a corporation on any of the following grounds: (1) The corporate franchise was procured through fraud practiced upon the state. (2) The corporation has continued to abuse authority conferred upon it. (3) The corporation should not have been formed under this Chapter, or has been formed thereunder without a substantial compliance with the conditions precedent to incorporation prescribed by this Chapter. C. In any case where the secretary of state revokes the articles of incorporation and the corporate franchise, as authorized in Subsection A of this Section, the secretary of state shall, without charge, record notice of such revocation in the conveyance records and the corporation's registry of the office of the clerk of court in the parish where the corporation maintains its registered office and, in the parish of Orleans, such notice shall be recorded in the office of the recorder of mortgages and register of conveyances for said parish. The corporation1 shall not be revoked if the corporation places itself in good standing. D. At least thirty days prior to revoking the articles of incorporation and the corporate franchise, as authorized by Subsection A of this Section, the secretary of state shall give notice to the affected corporation of his intention to revoke the articles of incorporation and the corporate franchise by directing notice of such intention to the last designated registered agent of such corporation, as shown on the records of his office. Such notice shall be in writing and sent to the registered agent by United States mail at the agent's last known address. If there is no registered agent of record, the notice shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office. E.(1) The certificate of incorporation and articles of incorporation shall be reinstated upon the filing, with the secretary of state and within three years from the effective date of the revocation, of an application of reinstatement, signed and acknowledged by an officer of the corporation, accompanied by a reinstatement fee and a current annual report. However, if a suit for liquidation or receivership has been filed at the time the reinstatement is applied for, then the unanimous written consent to the reinstatement by the shareholders, certified by the corporation's secretary to contain the signatures of all of the shareholders, must also be filed with the application for reinstatement. (2) The secretary of state shall furnish the certificate of reinstatement in duplicate, one copy of which shall be filed by the corporation with the clerk of court or, in Orleans Parish, with the recorder of mortgages and register of conveyances. Upon filing the current annual report and payment of the reinstatement fee and upon filing the unanimous written consent of the shareholders to the reinstatement, certified by the corporation's secretary if a suit for liquidation or receivership has been filed, the certificate of reinstatement of such charter and articles of incorporation shall be retroactive and the charter and articles of incorporation shall continue in existence as though the revocation had never occurred. (3) After revocation of the charter or articles of incorporation, the corporate name shall not be available to any other corporation for a three-year period. After three years have expired, if the corporate name is still available, the corporation can be reinstated by following the same procedures and by satisfying the same provisions and requirements as set forth herein. If the name is not available, an amendment changing the original name must be filed in the same manner as provided for in R.S. 12:238.

(b) The authorization by members of the mortgage or pledge of, or granting of a security interest in, property or assets of a corporation shall not be necessary except to the extent that the corporation's articles of organization or by-laws provide otherwise. (c) A corporation constituting a public charity shall give written notice to the attorney general not less than thirty days before making any sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition not referred to in subsection (b) of all or substantially all of its property and assets if that sale, lease, exchange or other disposition involves or will result in a material change in the nature of the activities conducted by the corporation, except that no such notice shall be required if a written waiver of such notice is executed by the attorney general before or after such sale, lease, exchange or other disposition.

No such notice shall be required if a written waiver of such notice is executed by the attorney general. When investigating the proposed transaction, the attorney general shall consider any factors that the attorney general deems relevant, including, but not limited to, whether: (i) the proposed transaction complies with applicable general nonprofit and charities law; (ii) due care was followed by the nonprofit entity; (iii) conflict of interest was avoided by the nonprofit entity at all phases of decision making; (iv) fair value will be received for the nonprofit assets; and (v) the proposed transaction is in the public interest. (2) The attorney general shall assess the entity proposing to receive such assets or operations for reasonable costs related to, and shall expend such amounts for the review of the proposed transaction, as determined by the attorney general to be necessary. Such reasonable costs may include expert review of the transaction, a process for educating the public about the transaction and obtaining public input, and administrative costs.

(a) A corporation may authorize, by vote of two-thirds of its members entitled to vote thereon or, in the case of a corporation having capital stock, by the holders of two-thirds of its capital stock entitled to vote thereon, at a meeting duly called for the purpose, with notice given as provided in section six B, the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of its property and assets upon such terms and conditions as it deems expedient, except that no such vote shall be required if such transaction does not involve or will not result in a material change in the nature of the activities conducted by the corporation. (b) The authorization by members of the mortgage or pledge of, or granting of a security interest in, property or assets of a corporation shall not be necessary except to the extent that the corporation's articles of organization or by-laws provide otherwise. (c) A corporation constituting a public charity shall give written notice to the attorney general not less than thirty days before making any sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition not referred to in subsection (b) of all or substantially all of its property and assets if that sale, lease, exchange or other disposition involves or will result in a material change in the nature of the activities conducted by the corporation, except that no such notice shall be required if a written waiver of such notice is executed by the attorney general before or after such sale, lease, exchange or other disposition. A certificate signed by an officer of the corporation which states that notice was not required, that notice was given, or that notice was waived by the attorney general, with respect to any sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of property by the corporation shall be conclusive in favor of any purchaser, lessee, transferee or other person relying thereon for purposes of determining compliance with the provisions of this subsection. (d)(1) A nonprofit acute-care hospital, as defined in section 25B of chapter 111, or a nonprofit health maintenance organization as defined in chapter 176G shall give written notice of not less than 90 days to the attorney general and to the commissioner of public health if such notice concerns a nonprofit health maintenance organization, before it enters into a sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of a substantial amount of its assets or operations with a person or entity other than a public charity. No such notice shall be required if a written waiver of such notice is executed by the attorney general. When investigating the proposed transaction, the attorney general shall consider any factors that the attorney general deems relevant, including, but not limited to, whether: (i) the proposed transaction complies with applicable general nonprofit and charities law; (ii) due care was followed by the nonprofit entity; (iii) conflict of interest was avoided by the nonprofit entity at all phases of decision making; (iv) fair value will be received for the nonprofit assets; and (v) the proposed transaction is in the public interest. (2) The attorney general shall assess the entity proposing to receive such assets or operations for reasonable costs related to, and shall expend such amounts for the review of the proposed transaction, as determined by the attorney general to be necessary. Such reasonable costs may include expert review of the transaction, a process for educating the public about the transaction and obtaining public input, and administrative costs. All materials filed by the parties in the course of the attorney general's review shall be made available for public inspection pursuant to section 10 of chapter 66 and section 7 of chapter 4. (3) The attorney general shall, during the course of his investigation, hold at least one public hearing, in a location convenient to the population served by the nonprofit entity, at which any person may file written comments and exhibits or appear and make a statement. At least 21 days in advance of the public hearing, the nonprofit entity shall publish notice of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation where the entity is located. The notice shall include the name of the nonprofit entity, the name of the acquirer, or other parties to the proposed transaction, the nature of the proposed transaction and the anticipated consideration that will be paid by the acquirer. In addition, the notice shall offer to provide to any person upon request to the nonprofit entity a detailed summary of the proposed transaction and copies of all transaction and collateral agreements. As defined in section 7 of chapter 4, compliance with this notice requirement will not require disclosure of confidential trade secret, commercial or financial information contained in schedules or exhibits of those agreements. (4) If a charitable fund results from the transaction, and if the nonprofit entity making the disposition does not continue its operation of a nonprofit hospital or nonprofit health maintenance organization, the governance of the charitable fund shall be subject to review by the attorney general and approval by the court. The governance of the charitable fund shall be broadly based in the community historically served by the predecessor nonprofit acute care hospital or health maintenance organization and shall be independent of the new for-profit entity. The attorney general shall conduct a public hearing in connection with his review of the plan for the governance of the resulting charitable fund. An appropriate portion of any resulting proceeds shall, if determined to be necessary by the attorney general, be used for assistance in the development of a community-based plan for the use of the resulting charitable fund. (5) The entity receiving such assets or operations shall, if determined to be necessary by the attorney general in consultation with the department of public health, provide the funds, in an amount determined by the commissioner of public health, for the hiring by the department of public health of an independent health care access monitor to monitor and report quarterly to the attorney general, the department of public health and the committee on health care on community health care access by the entity, including levels of free care provided by the entity. The funding shall be provided for three years after the transaction. The entity receiving such assets or operations shall provide the monitor with appropriate access to the entity's records in order to enable the monitor to fulfill this function. To prevent the duplication of any information already reported by the entity, the monitor shall, to the extent possible, utilize data already provided by the entity to the center for health information and analysis under chapter 12C or to any other agency. No personal identifiers shall be attached to any of the records obtained by the monitor and all such records shall be subject to the privacy and confidentiality provisions of section 70E of chapter 111. (6) No officer, director, incorporator, member, employee, staff, physician, expert or advisor of the nonprofit entity making the disposition shall derive improper benefit from the transaction. The officers, directors, incorporators, members, senior managers, staff, physicians, experts and advisors of the nonprofit entity making the disposition shall be prohibited from investing in the for-profit entity for a period of three years following such disposition.","Commissioner of Public Health, Mass.

Subd. 7. Dissolution as remedy. In deciding whether to order dissolution, the court shall consider whether lesser relief suggested by one or more parties, such as any form of equitable relief or a partial liquidation, would be adequate to permanently relieve the circumstances established under subdivision 3, 4, or 5. Lesser relief may be ordered if it would be appropriate under the facts and circumstances of the case. Subd. 8. Expenses. If the court finds that a party to a proceeding brought under this section has acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or otherwise not in good faith, it may award reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, to any of the other parties.

A court may grant equitable relief in an action by a director or at least 50 members with voting rights or ten percent of the members with voting rights, whichever is less, when it is established that: (1) the directors or the persons having the authority otherwise vested in the board are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, the members cannot break the deadlock, and the corporation or the parties have not provided for a procedure to resolve the dispute; (2) the directors or those in control of the corporation have acted fraudulently, illegally, or in a manner unfairly prejudicial toward one or more members in their capacities as members, directors, or officers; (3) the members of the corporation are so divided in voting power that, for a period that includes the time when two consecutive regular meetings were held, they have failed to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon the election and qualification of their successors; (4) the corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted; or (5) the period of duration as provided in the articles has expired. Subd. 4. Action by creditor.

Subd. 6. Condition of corporation.

Subd. 7. Dissolution as remedy. In deciding whether to order dissolution, the court shall consider whether lesser relief suggested by one or more parties, such as any form of equitable relief or a partial liquidation, would be adequate to permanently relieve the circumstances established under subdivision 3, 4, or 5. Lesser relief may be ordered if it would be appropriate under the facts and circumstances of the case. Subd. 8. Expenses.

This section shall not be applicable to corporations that filed reports deemed by the attorney general to be incomplete, erroneous or otherwise deficient. (b) No corporation shall be included in any list prepared pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section unless (1) in each of the last two years during which such corporation failed to file its annual report, the attorney general has sent to such corporation by certified mail return receipt requested notice that the corporation has failed to file and has three months from the date of such notice to file all delinquent reports and complete all registration requirements, provided, however, that if the last known address of record of the corporation is not within the United States, the notice to such corporation shall be sent by any other reasonable means, (2) the second such notice was sent at least six months prior to the date of the certification required by paragraph (a) of this section and (3) the attorney general used reasonable diligence to identify a current address for the corporation. (c) If the secretary of state, upon comparing the names so certified with his or her records, shall discover error, he or she may return the list to the attorney general for correction. (d) The secretary of state shall make a proclamation under his or her hand and seal of office as to each list received from the attorney general declaring any corporations whose names are included in such list to be dissolved and their certificates of incorporation to be forfeited. The secretary shall file the original proclamation in his or her office and shall publish a copy thereof in the state register no later than three months following receipt of the list by him or her. (e) Upon the publication of such proclamation in the manner proscribed in paragraph (d) of this section, each corporation named therein shall be deemed dissolved without further legal proceedings. (f) The secretary of state shall mail a copy of the state register containing such proclamation to the clerk of each county in the state. The county clerk shall file the copy without charge but need not record it. (g) The names of all corporations so dissolved shall be reserved for a period of one year immediately following the publication of the proclamation, and during such period no domestic business corporation, not-for-profit corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership shall be formed under a name the same as any name so reserved or which may not be distinguished from any name so reserved, nor shall any foreign business corporation, not-for-profit corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership, within such period, be authorized to do business or conduct activities in this state under a name the same as any name so reserved or which may not be distinguished from such any name so reserved. (h) Any corporation so dissolved may file in the department of state a written consent by the attorney general to the reinstatement of the corporation. Such written consent shall be given if the attorney general shall have received all annual financial reports and fees required by article 7-A of the executive law and article 8 of the estates, powers and trusts law and penalties and interest charges related thereto have been paid or waived. The filing of such consent shall have the effect of annulling all of the proceedings theretofore taken under the provisions of this section for the dissolution of such corporation with the same force and effect as if such proclamation had not been made or published. The fee of the secretary of state for filing such consent shall be fifty dollars. No such consent shall be filed if the name of a domestic not-for-profit corporation, business corporation, not-for-profit corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership formed later than one year after the publication of the proclamation of dissolution, or the name or fictitious name or of a foreign business corporation, not-for-profit corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership which has obtained authority to do business or conduct activities in the state later than one year after such proclamation, or name which has been reserved later than one year after such proclamation, is the same as or may not be distinguished from the name of the corporation filing such consent unless such corporation simultaneously files in the department of state a certificate of amendment to change the name of such corporation. Such certificate of amendment shall be executed in like manner as if such corporation had not been dissolved. (i) If, after the publication of such proclamation, it shall appear that the name of any corporation was erroneously included therein, the attorney general shall so certify to the secretary of state, and the secretary of state shall make appropriate entry on the records of the department of state, which entry shall have the effect of annulling all of the proceedings theretofore taken under the provisions of this section for the dissolution of such corporation with the same force and effect as if such proclamation had not been made or published. (j) Whenever a corporation shall have complied with paragraph (h) of this section or whenever the procedures specified in paragraph (i) of this section shall have been taken, the secretary of state shall publish a notice thereof in the state register and shall send a copy of such notice to the county clerk of the county in which, according to his or her records, the office of the corporation is located. Such county clerk shall file such copy and make appropriate entry on his or her records without charge. (k) If, after the dissolution of any corporation, assets of the corporation are located, the attorney general shall act with respect to such assets in accordance with this article and article 11 (Judicial dissolution). (a) On or before the last day of March, June, September and December in each calendar year, the attorney general may certify and transmit to the department of state a list containing the names of any or all corporations formed pursuant to this chapter and registered or required to register pursuant to article 7-A of the executive law or article 8 of the estates, powers and trusts law that have not filed annual financial reports for each of the five years immediately preceding the date of such certification. This section shall not be applicable to corporations that filed reports deemed by the attorney general to be incomplete, erroneous or otherwise deficient. (b) No corporation shall be included in any list prepared pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section unless (1) in each of the last two years during which such corporation failed to file its annual report, the attorney general has sent to such corporation by certified mail return receipt requested notice that the corporation has failed to file and has three months from the date of such notice to file all delinquent reports and complete all registration requirements, provided, however, that if the last known address of record of the corporation is not within the United States, the notice to such corporation shall be sent by any other reasonable means, (2) the second such notice was sent at least six months prior to the date of the certification required by paragraph (a) of this section and (3) the attorney general used reasonable diligence to identify a current address for the corporation. (c) If the secretary of state, upon comparing the names so certified with his or her records, shall discover error, he or she may return the list to the attorney general for correction. (d) The secretary of state shall make a proclamation under his or her hand and seal of office as to each list received from the attorney general declaring any corporations whose names are included in such list to be dissolved and their certificates of incorporation to be forfeited. The secretary shall file the original proclamation in his or her office and shall publish a copy thereof in the state register no later than three months following receipt of the list by him or her. (e) Upon the publication of such proclamation in the manner proscribed in paragraph (d) of this section, each corporation named therein shall be deemed dissolved without further legal proceedings. (f) The secretary of state shall mail a copy of the state register containing such proclamation to the clerk of each county in the state. The county clerk shall file the copy without charge but need not record it. (g) The names of all corporations so dissolved shall be reserved for a period of one year immediately following the publication of the proclamation, and during such period no domestic business corporation, not-for-profit corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership shall be formed under a name the same as any name so reserved or which may not be distinguished from any name so reserved, nor shall any foreign business corporation, not-for-profit corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership, within such period, be authorized to do business or conduct activities in this state under a name the same as any name so reserved or which may not be distinguished from such any name so reserved. (h) Any corporation so dissolved may file in the department of state a written consent by the attorney general to the reinstatement of the corporation. Such written consent shall be given if the attorney general shall have received all annual financial reports and fees required by article 7-A of the executive law and article 8 of the estates, powers and trusts law and penalties and interest charges related thereto have been paid or waived. The filing of such consent shall have the effect of annulling all of the proceedings theretofore taken under the provisions of this section for the dissolution of such corporation with the same force and effect as if such proclamation had not been made or published. The fee of the secretary of state for filing such consent shall be fifty dollars. No such consent shall be filed if the name of a domestic not-for-profit corporation, business corporation, not-for-profit corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership formed later than one year after the publication of the proclamation of dissolution, or the name or fictitious name or of a foreign business corporation, not-for-profit corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership which has obtained authority to do business or conduct activities in the state later than one year after such proclamation, or name which has been reserved later than one year after such proclamation, is the same as or may not be distinguished from the name of the corporation filing such consent unless such corporation simultaneously files in the department of state a certificate of amendment to change the name of such corporation. Such certificate of amendment shall be executed in like manner as if such corporation had not been dissolved. (i) If, after the publication of such proclamation, it shall appear that the name of any corporation was erroneously included therein, the attorney general shall so certify to the secretary of state, and the secretary of state shall make appropriate entry on the records of the department of state, which entry shall have the effect of annulling all of the proceedings theretofore taken under the provisions of this section for the dissolution of such corporation with the same force and effect as if such proclamation had not been made or published. (j) Whenever a corporation shall have complied with paragraph (h) of this section or whenever the procedures specified in paragraph (i) of this section shall have been taken, the secretary of state shall publish a notice thereof in the state register and shall send a copy of such notice to the county clerk of the county in which, according to his or her records, the office of the corporation is located. Such county clerk shall file such copy and make appropriate entry on his or her records without charge. (k) If, after the dissolution of any corporation, assets of the corporation are located, the attorney general shall act with respect to such assets in accordance with this article and article 11 (Judicial dissolution).","N-PCL § 1014",,,,,,,,,,"NY-DISSOLV-ADMINI-AG",1,"13","1648","id-ne-018","id-1648","Administrative Dissolutions - AG","{SS}: 1014 ;; {SS}: 1014"

(B) A complaint for judicial dissolution shall be verified by any of the complainants and shall set forth facts showing that the case is one of those specified in this section. Unless the complainants set forth in the complaint that they are unable to annex a list of members, a schedule shall be annexed to the complaint setting forth the name of each member and the member's address if it is known. (C) Upon the filing of a complaint for judicial dissolution, the court with which it is filed shall have power to issue injunctions, to appoint a receiver with such authority and duties as the court from time to time may direct, to take such other proceedings as may be necessary to protect the property or the rights of the complainants or of the persons interested, and to carry on the activities of the corporation until a full hearing can be had. Upon or after the filing of a complaint for judicial dissolution, the court, by injunction or order, may stay the prosecution of any proceeding against the corporation or involving any of its property and require the parties to it to present and prove their claims, demands, rights, interests, or liens, at the time and in the manner required of creditors or others. The court may refer the complaint to a special master commissioner. (D) After a hearing had upon such notice as the court may direct to be given to all parties to the proceeding and to any other parties in interest designated by the court, a final order based either upon the evidence, or upon the report of the special master commissioner if one has been appointed, shall be made dissolving the corporation or dismissing the complaint.

A certified copy of such order forthwith shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state, whereupon the corporation shall be dissolved. To the extent consistent with orders entered in such proceeding, the effect of such judicial dissolution shall be the same as in the case of voluntary dissolution, and the provisions of sections 1702.49, 1702.50, and 1702.51 of the Revised Code relating to the authority and duties of directors during the winding up of the affairs of a corporation dissolved voluntarily, with respect to the jurisdiction of courts over the winding up of the affairs of a corporation, and with respect to receivers for winding up the affairs of a corporation shall be applicable to corporations judicially dissolved. (E) A judicial proceeding under this section concerning the judicial dissolution of a corporation is a special proceeding, and final orders in the proceeding may be vacated, modified, or reversed on appeal pursuant to the Rules of Appellate Procedure or the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court, whichever are applicable, and, to the extent not in conflict with those rules, Chapter 2505. of the Revised Code.

Any one or more nonstock domestic corporations may merge or consolidate with one or more other foreign nonstock corporations, unless the laws of the jurisdiction or jurisdictions under which such foreign nonstock corporation or corporations are organized prohibit such merger or consolidation. The constituent corporations may merge into a single surviving corporation, which may be any one of the constituent corporations, or they may consolidate into a new resulting nonstock corporation formed by the consolidation, which may be a corporation of the jurisdiction of organization of any one of the constituent corporations, pursuant to an agreement of merger or consolidation, as the case may be, complying and approved in accordance with the provisions of this section. The term ""foreign nonstock corporation"" means a nonstock corporation organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than this state. B. 1. All the constituent corporations shall enter into an agreement of merger or consolidation. The agreement shall state: a.the terms and conditions of the merger or consolidation, b.the mode of carrying the same into effect, c.in the case of a merger in which the surviving corporation is a domestic corporation, such amendments or changes in the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation as are desired to be effected by the merger, which amendments or changes many amend and restate the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation in its entirety, or, if no such amendments or changes are desired, a statement that the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation shall be its certificate of incorporation, d.in the case of a consolidation in which the resulting corporation is a domestic corporation, that the certificate of incorporation of the resulting corporation shall be as is set forth in an attachment to the agreement, e.the manner, if any, of converting the memberships or membership interests of each of the constituent corporations into memberships or membership interests of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or of canceling some or all of the memberships or membership interests, and if any memberships or membership interests of any of the constituent corporations are not to remain outstanding, to be converted solely into memberships or membership interests of the surviving or resulting corporation or to be cancelled, the cash, property, rights or securities of any other corporation or entity which the holders of such memberships or membership interests are to receive in exchange for, or upon conversion of, such memberships or membership interests, which cash, property, rights or securities of any other corporation or entity may be in addition to or in lieu of memberships or membership interests of the surviving or resulting corporation, f.such other details and provisions as shall be deemed desirable including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a provision for the payment of cash in lieu of the issuance or recognition of fractional shares, rights or other securities of any other corporation or entity the shares, rights or other securities of which are to be received in the merger or consolidation, or for some other arrangement with respect thereto, consistent with Section 1036 of this title, and g.such other provisions or facts as required to set forth in an agreement of merger or consolidation, including any provision for amendment of the certificate of incorporation or equivalent document, or a surviving foreign nonstock corporation by the laws of each jurisdiction under which any of the foreign nonstock corporation are organized. 2. Any of the terms of the agreement of merger or consolidation may be made dependent upon facts ascertainable outside of such agreement, provided that the manner in which such facts shall operate upon the terms of the agreement is clearly and expressly set forth in the agreement of merger or consolidation. The term ""facts,"" as used in the preceding sentence includes, but is not limited to, the occurrence of any event including a determination or action by any person or body, including the corporation. C. The agreement shall be adopted, approved, certified, executed and acknowledged by each of the constituent corporations in accordance with the laws under which it is organized and, in the case of domestic corporation, in the same manner as is provided for in Section 1084 of this title. The agreement shall be filed and shall become effective for all purposes of the laws of this state when and as provided for in Section 1084 of this title with respect to the merger of nonstock domestic corporations. Insofar as they may be applicable, the provisions of paragraphs 1 through 9 of subsection C of Section 1082 of this title shall apply to a merger under this section, and the reference therein to ""shareholder"" shall be deemed to include ""member"" hereunder. D. If the corporation surviving or resulting from the merger or consolidation is a foreign nonstock corporation, it shall agree that it may be served with process in this state in any proceeding for enforcement of any obligation of any constituent domestic corporation, as well as for enforcement of any obligation of the surviving or resulting corporation arising from the merger or consolidation and shall irrevocably appoint the Secretary of State as its agent to accept service of process in any suit or other proceedings and shall specify the address to which a copy of such process shall be mailed by the Secretary of State. In the event of such service upon the Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of Section 2004 of Title 12 of the Oklahoma Statutes, the Secretary of State shall immediately notify such surviving or resulting corporation thereof by letter, certified mail, return receipt requested, directed to such corporation at its address so specified, unless such surviving or resulting corporation shall have designated in writing to the Secretary of State a different address for such purpose, in which case it shall be mailed to the last address so designated. Such letter shall enclose a copy of the process and any other papers served upon the Secretary of State. It shall be the duty of the plaintiff in the event of such service to serve process and any other papers in duplicate, to notify the Secretary of State that service is being made pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, and to pay the Secretary of State the fee prescribed by paragraph 7 of Section 1142 of this title, which fee shall be taxed as part of the costs in the proceeding if the plaintiff shall prevail therein. The Secretary of State shall maintain an alphabetical record of any such service setting forth the name of the plaintiff and defendant, the title, docket number and nature of the proceeding in which process has been served upon him, the fact that service has been effected pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the return date thereof, and the date when the service was made. The Secretary of State shall not be required to retain such information for a period longer than five (5) years from his receipt of service of process. E. The provisions of subsection E of Section 1081 of this title shall apply to a merger pursuant to the provisions of this section if the corporation surviving the merger is a domestic corporation. F.

After a corporation has received payment for any of its capital stock, or after a nonstock corporation has members, it may amend its certificate of incorporation, from time to time, in any and as many respects as may be desired, so long as its certificate of incorporation as amended would contain only such provisions as it would be lawful and proper to insert in an original certificate of incorporation filed at the time of the filing of the amendment; and if a change in stock or the rights of shareholders, or an exchange, reclassification, subdivision, combination, or cancellation of stock or rights of shareholders is to be made, such provisions as may be necessary to effect such change, exchange, reclassification, subdivision, combination, or cancellation. In particular, and without limitation upon the general power of amendment, a corporation may amend its certificate of incorporation, from time to time, so as: a.to change its corporate name, b.to change, substitute, enlarge or diminish the nature of its business or its corporate powers and purposes, c.to increase or decrease its authorized capital stock or to reclassify the same, by changing the number, par value, designations, preferences, or relative, participating, optional, or other special rights of the shares, or the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such rights, or by changing shares with par value into shares without par value, or shares without par value into shares with par value either with or without increasing or decreasing the number of shares or by subdividing or combining the outstanding shares of any class or series of a class of shares into a greater or lesser number of outstanding shares, d.to cancel or otherwise affect the right of the holders of the shares of any class to receive dividends which have accrued but have not been declared, e.to create new classes of stock having rights and preferences either prior and superior or subordinate and inferior to the stock of any class then authorized, whether issued or unissued, f.to change the period of its duration, or g.to delete (1) such provisions of the original certificate of incorporation which named the incorporator or incorporators, the initial board of directors and the original subscribers for shares, and (2) such provisions contained in any amendment to the certificate of incorporation as were necessary to effect a change, exchange, reclassification, subdivision, combination or cancellation of stock, if such change, exchange, reclassification, subdivision, combination or cancellation has become effective. 2. Any or all changes or alterations provided for in paragraph 1 of this subsection may be effected by one certificate of amendment. B. Every amendment authorized by the provisions of subsection A of this section shall be made and effected in the following manner: 1. If the corporation has capital stock, its board of directors shall adopt a resolution setting forth the amendment proposed, declaring its advisability, and either calling a special meeting of the shareholders entitled to vote in respect thereof for the consideration of the amendment or directing that the amendment proposed be considered at the next annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that unless otherwise expressly required by the certificate of incorporation, no meeting or vote of shareholders shall be required to adopt an amendment that effects only changes described in paragraph (a) or (g) of subsection A of this section. The special or annual meeting shall be called and held upon notice in accordance with the provisions of Section 1067 of this title. The notice shall set forth the amendment in full or a brief summary of the changes to be effected thereby, unless such notice constitutes a notice of Internet availability of proxy materials under the rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. At the meeting a vote of the shareholders entitled to vote thereon shall be taken for and against any proposed amendment that requires adoption by shareholders. If no vote of shareholders is required to effect such amendment, or if a majority of the outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon, and a majority of the outstanding stock of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class, has been voted in favor of the amendment, a certificate setting forth the amendment and certifying that the amendment has been duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be executed, acknowledged and filed and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of Section 1007 of this title. 2. The holders of the outstanding shares of a class shall be entitled to vote as a class upon a proposed amendment, whether or not entitled to vote thereon by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, if the amendment would increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of the class, increase or decrease the par value of the shares of the class, or alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of the class so as to affect them adversely. If any proposed amendment would alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of one or more series of any class so as to affect them adversely, but shall not so affect the entire class, then only the shares of the series so affected by the amendment shall be considered a separate class for the purposes of this paragraph. The number of authorized shares of any such class or classes of stock may be increased or decreased, but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the corporation entitled to vote irrespective of the provisions of this paragraph, if so provided in the original certificate of incorporation, in any amendment thereto which created the class or classes of stock or which was adopted prior to the issuance of any shares of the class or classes of stock, or in any amendment thereto which was authorized by a resolution or resolutions adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the class or classes of stock. 3. If the corporation is a nonstock corporation, then the governing body thereof shall adopt a resolution setting forth the amendment proposed and declaring its advisability. If a majority of all the members of the governing body shall vote in favor of the amendment, a certificate thereof shall be executed, acknowledged and filed and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of Section 1007 of this title. The certificate of incorporation of any nonstock corporation may contain a provision requiring an amendment thereto to be approved by a specified number or percentage of the members or of any specified class of members of the corporation in which event the proposed amendment shall be submitted to the members or to any specified class of members of the corporation in the same manner, so far as applicable, as is provided for in this section for an amendment to the certificate of incorporation of a stock corporation; and in the event of the adoption thereof by the members, a certificate evidencing the amendment shall be executed, acknowledged and filed and shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of Section 1007 of this title. 4. Whenever the certificate of incorporation shall require action by the board of directors of a corporation other than a nonstock corporation or by the governing body of a nonstock corporation, by the holders of any class or series of shares or by the members, or by the holders of any other securities having voting power, the vote of a greater number or proportion than is required by the provisions of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act, the provision of the certificate of incorporation requiring a greater vote shall not be altered, amended, or repealed except by a greater vote. C. The resolution authorizing a proposed amendment to the certificate of incorporation may provide that at any time prior to the effectiveness of the filing of the amendment with the Secretary of State, notwithstanding authorization of the proposed amendment by the shareholders of the corporation or by the members of a nonstock corporation, the board of directors or governing body may abandon the proposed amendment without further action by the shareholders or members.

If the members of a corporation having no capital stock are entitled to vote for the election of members of its governing body or are entitled to vote for dissolution under the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of such corporation, they shall perform all the acts necessary for dissolution which are required by the provisions of Section 1096 of this title to be performed by the shareholders of a corporation having capital stock, including dissolution without action of the members of the governing body if all the members of the corporation entitled to vote thereon shall consent in writing and a certificate of dissolution shall be filed with the Secretary of State pursuant to subsection D of Section 1096 of this title. If there is no member entitled to vote thereon, the dissolution of the corporation shall be authorized at a meeting of the governing body, upon the adoption of a resolution to dissolve by the vote of a majority of members of its governing body then in office. In all other respects, the method and proceedings for the dissolution of a nonstock corporation shall conform as nearly as may be to the proceedings prescribed by the provisions of Section 1096 of this title for the dissolution of corporations having capital stock.

For purposes of this subparagraph: (i) A court may find that a corporation is a shell entity if the court determines that the corporation was used or incorporated for an illegal purpose, was used or incorporated to defraud or deceive a person or a governmental agency or was used or incorporated to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or a governmental agency; and (ii) The Attorney General may make a prima facie showing that a corporation is a shell entity by stating in an affidavit that: (I) The corporation did not provide a name or address required by the Secretary of State, or the name or address the corporation provided was false, fraudulent or inadequate; (II) The corporationis articles of incorporation, a record the corporation must keep under ORS 65.771 or the corporationis annual report is false, fraudulent or inadequate; (III) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, attempted to communicate with, or serve legal process upon, the corporation at the address or by means of other contract information the corporation provided to the Secretary of State, but the corporation failed to respond; or (IV) The Attorney General has other evidence that shows that the corporation was used or incorporated for an illegal purpose, was used or incorporated to defraud or deceive a person or a governmental agency or was used or incorporated to fraudulently conceal any business activity from another person or a governmental agency. (b) Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of a religious corporation, in a proceeding by 50 members or members holding five percent or more of the voting power, whichever is less, or by a director or any person specified in the articles of incorporation, if the court finds that: (A) The directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, and the members, if any, are unable to break the deadlock; (B) The directors or those in control of the corporation have acted, are acting or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive or fraudulent; (C) The members are deadlocked in voting power and have failed, for a period that includes at least two consecutive annual meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired; (D) The corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted; or (E) The corporation is a public benefit corporation or religious corporation and is no longer able to carry out the public benefit corporationis or religious corporationis purposes; (c) In a proceeding by a creditor if the court finds that: (A) The creditoris claim has been reduced to judgment, the execution on the judgment has been returned unsatisfied and the corporation is insolvent; or (B) The corporation has admitted in writing that the creditoris claim is due and owing and the corporation is insolvent; or (d) In a proceeding by the corporation to have the corporationis voluntary dissolution continued under court supervision. (2) Before dissolving a corporation, the court shall consider whether: (a) Reasonable alternatives to dissolution exist; (b) Dissolution is in the public interest, if the corporation is a public benefit corporation; or (c) Dissolution is the best way of protecting the interests of members, if the corporation is a mutual benefit corporation. (3) In addition to subjecting a corporation to dissolution under subsection (1)(a)(F) of this section, a finding that a corporation is a shell entity has the following effects: (a) A court may rebuttably presume that the corporationis filings with the Secretary of State constitute a false claim, as defined in ORS 180.750, in any action the Attorney General brings against the corporation under ORS 180.760 and may award to the Attorney General reasonable attorney fees and the costs of investigation, preparation and litigation if the Attorney General prevails in the action; and (b) A public body, as defined in ORS 174.109, in any proceeding against the corporation, may move to enjoin a director, officer or other person that exercises significant direction or control over the corporation from engaging in commercial activity in this state, including but not limited to incorporating or organizing an entity in this state. (4) A corporation may affirmatively defend against an allegation that the corporation is a shell entity by showing that the corporation, within 60 days after receiving a request to provide or correct a name, address or other information required for a filing or in articles of incorporation, a record the corporation must keep or an annual report, or within 60 days after the date of a request to respond to a communication or service of process, provided or corrected the name, address or other information or responded to the communication or service of process.

Removal of directors.(a) Removal by the members.-- (1) Unless otherwise provided in a bylaw adopted by the members, the entire board of directors, or a class of the board where the board is classified with respect to the power to select directors, or any individual director of a nonprofit corporation may be removed from office without assigning any cause by the vote of members, or a class of members, entitled to elect directors, or the class of directors. In case the board or a class of the board or any one or more directors are so removed, new directors may be elected at the same meeting. (2) An individual director shall not be removed, unless the entire board or class of the board is removed, from the board of a corporation in which members are entitled to vote cumulatively for the board or a class of the board if sufficient votes are cast against the resolution for removal of the director which, if cumulatively voted at an annual or other regular election of directors, would be sufficient to elect one or more directors to the board or to the class. (b) Removal by the board.--Unless otherwise provided in a bylaw adopted by the members, the board of directors may declare vacant the office of a director who has been judicially declared of unsound mind or who has been convicted of an offense punishable by imprisonment for a term of more than one year, or for any other proper cause which the bylaws may specify, or if, within 60 days, or other time as the bylaws may specify, after notice of selection, a director does not accept the office either in writing or by attending a meeting of the board of directors and fulfill the other requirements of qualification as the bylaws may specify. (c) Removal by the court.--Upon application of any member or director, the court may remove from office any director in case of fraudulent or dishonest acts, or gross abuse of authority or discretion with reference to the corporation, or for any other proper cause, and may bar from office any director so removed for a period prescribed by the court. The corporation shall be made a party to the action and, as a prerequisite to the maintenance of an action under this subsection, a member shall comply with Subchapter G (relating to judicial supervision of corporate action). (d) Effect of reinstatement.--An act of the board done during the period when a director has been suspended or removed for cause shall not be impugned or invalidated if the suspension or removal is thereafter rescinded by the members or by the board or by the final judgment of a court.
